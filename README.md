# CA-Sac-open-data
processes data for Sacramento city and county obtained from the Sacramento Open Data Portal and/or California Public Records Act requests.

# Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD)
From City of Sacramento OpenData portal using keyword search for "dispatch": https://data.cityofsacramento.org/search?collection=dataset&q=dispatch

# Records Management Systems (RMS)
Received via PRA request to Sacramento Police Department: https://pdcityofsacramentoca.nextrequest.com/requests/24-748

# Notes
As described in Request 24-748, when I initially searched for the CAD and RMS tables, neither were available in the City or County's OpenData portal. After some back and forth with SacPD, the RMS tables were uploaded to the SacPD PRA portal, but the CAD tables were not. Instead, I noticed the CAD tables appeared in the City's portal and downloaded those files. Although there were not as many years uploaded as I had requested, SacPD had closed the request (Request 24-748) and did not respond to follow-up message under that original request, even though it appeared from their language that they intended to upload the CAD tables to the PRA portal and may have accidentally forgotten ("Further information on the CAD files: The dispatch date/time field was not available for the first several years of our current CAD system. That field starts to populate in later years." but no CAD files attached).

I submitted a new PRA request to SacPD, Request 24-989, which referenced Request 24-748 and the lack of CAD files available in the department response, but after 10 days the department responded with, "Can you please explain what you mean by CAD tables?" Seemingly having ignored the language of the request and/or the referenced prior request that contained a full explanation of what I was looking for from the department (or the County or City OpenData portal, which is intended to have both the RMS and CAD data available for download). My original request took more than 30 days of follow up and clarification until the department gave me a partial response, and this question from the department signaled that I was in for another round of delays and weeks of hovering over the PRA portal before I might get the rest of the CAD files.

So, I let it go and proceeded with the RMS tables received from PRA request and the 6 or so years of CAD data from the City of Sacramento OpenData portal.

**Here is the initial message to SacPD in Request 24-748:**

> Pursuant to the California Public Records Act, I am trying to obtain a copy of the Sacramento Police Department's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Records Management Systems (RMS) data.
>
> According to the Dispatch and Crime Data Portals page, these are available for download from the Open Data Portal, but I am unable to locate the CAD or RMS data in the Open Data Portals for both the city and county of Sacramento. Specifically, the keywords "crime", "dispatch", "police", and "record" on both the city and county open data portals do not yield the CAD or RMS tables.
>
> I would like each database copy to be made available as an Excel (.xlsx) file, if possible.

I have also saved PDF screenshots of the PRA portal detailing the exchange between myself and SacPD, should the portal or those requests become unavailable.
